# Geometry

Python bindings for the [manif-geom-cpp](https://github.com/goromal/manif-geom-cpp) library.

These bindings are built using Pybind11, and require Eigen and manif-geom-cpp to be installed (or otherwise locateable with CMake) on your system.

Once built, the Python library file (of the form `geometry.cpython-*.so`) will be located in the `build/` folder.
